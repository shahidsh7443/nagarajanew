				direction for improvement. They are essential to your 
				Toastmasters experience—they show you what you do well and what 
				you might consider practicing more. Without constructive 
				criticism from others, you may not grow as a communicator or 
				leader.<br />
				<br />
				You have likely already witnessed the benefit of evaluations in 
				your club. A member speaks, receives verbal and written feedback 
				from another Toastmaster, and then uses those comments to 
				improve the next speech. The evaluator’s goal is to give the 
				speaker constructive feedback that will help them improve.</td>

				listen more attentively, refine your critical thinking abilities 
				and give feedback tactfully. You are tasked with considering 
				many different factors, such as effective speech delivery 
				techniques, the speaker’s skill level, habits and mannerisms, as

				<br />
				■ Good evaluators always offer suggestions and areas for 
				improvement. Never expect to receive an<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evaluation that is all praise.<br />
				■ Evaluations are based on opinion. Though evaluators follow the 
				guidelines established in the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Evaluation and Feedback” project at Level 1, comments are 
				still subjective and you may not always<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agree with your evaluator.<br />
				■ Many members believe effective evaluations are sometimes 
				difficult to give and receive. This is why<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being the evaluator can be challenging. You will become 
				a better evaluator by observing effective<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evaluations and by giving more evaluations at club
