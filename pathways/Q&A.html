				<strong>Why do I need to disable my pop-blockers on Base Camp

				<br />
				It is common configuration for learning management systems and 
				other websites to open additional content in new windows. Often, 
				these new windows are recognized as pop-ups by your web browser. 
				Because projects, tutorials, and resources on Base Camp all open 
				in new windows, your pop-up blockers must be turned off so your 
				browser does not prevent you from accessing them.<br />

				For instructions on how to disable your pop-up blockers, find

				<strong>What are the costs associated with Pathways?<br />
				<br />
				</strong>Your regular membership dues cover the cost of your 
				first path, however, if you choose the printed materials option 
				for your path, there is a $25 printing fee. The cost for an 
				additional path is $20, and if you elect to work in printed 
				materials, the $25 printing fee also applies.<br />
				<br />
				If you are working in one path and decide to switch to another 
				path, you do not need to pay an additional $20 as long as you 
				make the exchange within 30 days of the original purchase. The 
				$25 fee you pay for a path with printed materials is not 
				refundable. Remember: you can always print out copies of the 
				Pathways materials on your own, at no charge. If you are 
				enrolled in Pathways online, you can print out any of the 
				materials on Base Camp.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Do I still have to pay a new member fee now that there 
				are no Competent Communication (CC) or Competent Leadership (CL) 
				manuals in Pathways?<br />
				<br />
				</strong>Yes. Although new members will not receive a physical 
				kit when they begin in Pathways, the new member fee covers 
				membership processing costs, your first path, and access to Base 
				Camp and its resources.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>If I choose an online path, which means my learning 
				materials are all digital, why do I still need to pay for 
				Pathways if I’m not receiving manuals and other printed 
				materials?<br />
				<br />
				</strong>While it’s true that members who choose a path on Base 
				Camp will not receive physical manuals or materials, Pathways 
				gives you access to a richer learning experience, featuring 10 
				paths to choose from, over 300 real-world skills to learn and 
				in-depth training resources to help you every step of the way. 
				In addition, there are still costs associated with maintaining 
				the Pathways learning experience, including software licensing, 
				support and ongoing educational development.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>I pay dues twice a year. Why don’t I receive a new path 
				every time I pay dues?<br />
				<br />
				</strong>Dues cover your ongoing membership as well as services 
				provided to you, your club and your district. In Pathways, each 
				new member receives one free path, just like you received a 
				Competent Communication (CC) and Competent Leadership (CL) 
				manual without any additional costs when you joined the 
				traditional education program. Additional paths must be 
				purchased individually in Pathways, similar to the traditional 
				education program, which requires you to pay for additional 
				manuals beyond the CC and the CL.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>When I purchase an additional print path, do I need to 
				pay the materials fee again? And do I also have to pay a shipping fee for each path?</strong><br />
				<br />
				Each time you purchase a print path, you pay a materials fee. 
				This fee covers the cost of your materials and shipping. 
				Shipping cost is included in the materials fee.</td>

				<td class="style206">
				1. There are no refunds on educational materials or customized

				be returned for a refund as long as the member contacts 
				Toastmasters International within 30 days of receipt of the 
				item; after 30 days no refunds can be initiated. Returned items 
				must be in like-new condition.<br />
				<br />
				2. Educational materials and all other non-customized items can 
				be exchanged as long as the member contacts Toastmasters 
				International within 30 days of receipt of the item. Exchanges 
				of paths in the Pathways learning experience are limited to one 
				path per member, per program year. After 30 days no exchanges 
				can be initiated.<br />
				<br />
				3. The new item for an exchange must be selected at the time the 
				exchange is made; members are not given a “credit” to select a 
				new item at a later time.<br />
				<br />
				4. Any time an item is being returned or exchanged, including 
				when it is exchanged due to damage or a shipping error, 
				Toastmasters International reserves the right to require that 
				the original item be returned to Toastmasters International 
				and/or require a photo of the damage. When a damaged item must 
				be sent back to Toastmasters International, the replacement 
				item, if applicable, will be sent after the returned item is 
				received at World Headquarters.<br />
				<br />
				5. For exchanges due to item(s) being incorrect or damaged when 
				the member receives them, the item(s) will be replaced at no 
				cost to the member. Depending on the member’s location, 
				Toastmasters International may provide a return label for the 
				member to use or reimbursement to the member after he/she incurs 
				the expense.<br />

				<strong>How Do I Become a PATHWAYS Mentor? </strong>Toastmasters 
				International places high value on the skills, expertise and 
				wisdom members can share with others.<br />
				<br />
				If supporting and helping others grow interests you, consider 
				embarking on the <em>Pathways Mentor Program</em>. In the <em>
				Pathways Mentor Program</em>, you evaluate your goals as a 
				mentor and the strengths you bring to a mentoring relationship, 
				complete a short-term mentorship to apply your skills and commit 
				to a longer, six-month mentorship to demonstrate your success as 
				a mentor. When you complete the <em>Pathways Mentor Program</em>, 
				you receive a certificate recognizing your achievement. After 
				you complete all projects in the Pathways Mentor Program as well 
				as an entire path, you become a Pathways Mentor. Your 
				Toastmasters and Base Camp profile will show that you are a 
				designated Pathways Mentor.<br />
				<br />
				If you’re participating in Pathways, you will learn about 
				mentorship in the “Introduction to Toastmasters Mentoring” 
				project at Level 2. You learn what it means to be a mentor and 
				protégé and see your potential to achieve as a Toastmasters 
				mentor. When you complete all projects at Level 2, you can 
				enroll in the Pathways Mentor Program. Simply indicate your 
				interest when prompted on Base Camp or by your VPE.
